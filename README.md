AirBnb Clone project - the console

This project is meant to create the backend of AirBnB web app and all its functionality. We are also expected to create a console to imitate the frontend. 

The command interpreter - The start

The command interpreter should only run whenever the file console is being run. 

The command interpreter - The Use

The command interpreter should be able to allow the user to create, read, edit, update and delete data from the application just by manipulating strings on the command interpreter

for example:

(hbnb) create User  

the above line should be able to create a user on the command line and then be able to create a unique_id for the user while also storing it on the system backend
